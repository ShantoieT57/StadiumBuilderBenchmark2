# Styling Centralisation Policy

## Core Principle

All styling lives in a single set of centralised design tokens. Components reference tokens by name — never by hex literal, never by inline rgba(), never by hard-coded Tailwind colour utilities. The reason: when the user revisits styling later (a `/style-update` slash command is planned), token-level edits propagate across the entire app. Scattered styling means every "let me tweak the brand colour" turns into a multi-file refactor.

This policy is **enforced inline during BUILD** by `design-style-agent` (on-demand), applied by the `developer` agent as it writes components, and **gated automatically** by the styling check in `quality-gates.js` — which runs inline per story (the light `lint` gate, continue.md Step B4) and again in the epic-end full suite.

---

## What "Centralised" Means

The single source of truth for styling in this template is **`app-frontend/src/app/globals.css`** — specifically the `:root` and `.dark` blocks (Shadcn token names, **raw hex** values — Tailwind v4 `oklch()` approximations drift from brand colours, so we keep hex). When `design-style-agent` is invoked on-demand during BUILD, it produces overrides at `generated-docs/specs/design-tokens.css` and integrates them into `globals.css`.

Tokens cover:

- **Colours** — `--primary`, `--background`, `--foreground`, `--muted`, `--accent`, `--destructive`, `--border`, etc. (Shadcn convention)
- **Typography** — `--font-sans`, `--font-mono` (Tailwind `@theme`)
- **Spacing** — `--spacing-*` if customised; otherwise the Tailwind default scale
- **Radii** — `--radius`
- **Shadows** — `--shadow-*` if customised
- **Z-index** — `--z-*` if customised

If a component needs a value not represented by an existing token, the correct action is to **add a token**, not hard-code the value.

---

## Mandatory Rules

1. **Components reference tokens by name.** Use `var(--primary)`, `bg-primary`, `text-foreground`, etc. — the Shadcn/Tailwind helpers map to the underlying tokens.

2. **No hex literals in component code.** Anything matching `#[0-9a-fA-F]{3,8}\b` outside `globals.css` / `design-tokens.css` is a violation. Exceptions: SVG path attributes inside imported icons, and explicit comments documenting reference values.

3. **No inline `rgb()` / `rgba()` / `hsl()` / `oklch()` in component code.** Same reasoning — colour values belong in tokens (which themselves use raw hex).

4. **No Tailwind palette utilities for brand colours.** `bg-blue-600`, `text-red-500`, etc. are acceptable for transient design (e.g., a placeholder screen) but must be replaced before story commit. The brand palette goes in tokens; components use semantic helpers (`bg-primary`, `text-destructive`).

5. **Dark mode must work end-to-end.** Every colour token has a `:root` value AND a `.dark` value. Components must NOT hard-code light-mode-only colours.

6. **No styling in `documentation/` artifacts dictates production directly.** The design digest's **Palette & Typography** section (raw values the `design-interpreter` carried verbatim from wherever they lived in the design) is an *input* to `intake-agent` (and later `design-style-agent` if invoked), not the final production tokens. It is reviewed, merged into the Shadcn convention, and the user signs off at the INTAKE approval.

7. **Brief-level styling stays high-level.** During INTAKE, `project.md` §Styling & Branding captures palette (raw hex) and font family only. Component-specific styling (button radii, card shadows, etc.) emerges on demand during BUILD — not at INTAKE.

8. **Font files are never fetched by hand.** No `curl`, no `wget`, no download script, no copying binaries out of `node_modules`. How a font reaches the browser is decided by the branch table in [Font Delivery](#font-delivery) below.

---

## INTAKE Stage Behaviour

The `intake-agent` populates `project.md` §Styling & Branding with raw hex values. Two patterns:

**Pattern A — Defaulted (no source):**
```markdown
- `[DEFAULT]` Palette: neutral light-mode default; primary `#2563eb` (Tailwind blue-600), neutrals from Tailwind `slate`
- `[DEFAULT]` Font family: system UI stack
- `[DEFAULT]` Dark mode: not enabled (can be introduced later)
- `[DEFAULT]` Component-specific styling deferred — emerges during BUILD
```

**Pattern B — Inferred from source (the design digest supplies a palette, a BRD mentions branding, etc.):**
```markdown
- `[INFERRED]` Palette: dark theme with brand accents `#1A1A2E` / `#E94560` (from the design digest's Palette & Typography section)
- `[INFERRED]` Font family: Inter for headings, system stack for body (from the design digest)
- `[INFERRED]` Dark mode: primary mode is dark
```

The user edits these freely at the INTAKE approval (free-text or direct file edit). Whatever is approved becomes the input to `design-style-agent` when it's invoked during BUILD.

---

## Font Delivery

`project.md` §Styling & Branding records the font **family** — a fact about the design. How that family reaches the browser is a BUILD decision, made here. A design source and the digest may state the family; neither dictates the delivery mechanism.

Pick the branch by where the font comes from:

| Recorded family | What BUILD does |
|---|---|
| `[DEFAULT]` system UI stack — nothing specified | **Nothing** — no font loading at all |
| A family published on Google Fonts | `next/font/google` — no dependency, no files |
| A family published on npm (a foundry package, `@fontsource[-variable]/<family>`, etc.) | Install it as a dependency, then load it — a new dependency, so the Tier 4 halt in [agent-autonomy.md](../shared/agent-autonomy.md#tier-4--halt) applies as for any package |
| Font files the user supplied in `documentation/` | Copy into `app-frontend/public/fonts/`, load with `next/font/local`, keep the licence file beside them |
| A named family matching none of the above | **Halt and ask the user** (Tier 4) — this is a licensing question, not a technical one |

**If no branch reaches the font, that IS the answer — halt.** Fetching the binary yourself commits it with no lockfile entry and no integrity hash, and skips the licence question the last row exists to raise. When a user has a font no branch reaches, the resolution is for *them* to put the file in `documentation/` — which turns it into row 4.

`next/font` self-hosts by default: it fetches at **build** time and emits the font as a static asset of the app, so a built app makes no runtime request to a font CDN. Serving fonts from your own origin therefore needs no hand-rolled `@font-face` and no committed binaries. Never hotlink a font stylesheet at runtime — no `@import` from a font CDN, no `<link>` to one — whatever the design source did.

---

## BUILD Stage Behaviour — design-style-agent (on-demand)

When invoked, `design-style-agent`:

1. Reads `project.md` §Styling & Branding and the design digest's **Palette & Typography** section (raw values the interpreter carried verbatim) or any user-provided BRD branding section
2. Designs the complete `:root` and `.dark` token blocks in raw hex — overriding Shadcn defaults where the brief specified brand colours, keeping defaults where it didn't
3. Writes the override file to `generated-docs/specs/design-tokens.css`
4. Writes the human-readable rationale to `generated-docs/specs/design-tokens.md`
5. After user sign-off, integrates the override into `app-frontend/src/app/globals.css`

The agent must NEVER produce component-specific stylesheets — only the token layer.

---

## BUILD Stage Behaviour — developer agent

The `developer` agent must enforce the rules above when writing components:

- Reach for Shadcn components first (`<Button />`, `<Card />`, etc.) — they already reference tokens via `bg-primary`, `text-primary-foreground`, etc.
- When adding new styling, use the Tailwind helper that maps to a token (`bg-muted`, `text-foreground`, `border-border`, `rounded-md`)
- If a needed value has no token, **add a token to `globals.css`** rather than hard-coding the value

If the developer agent hits a wall (the design genuinely requires a value with no semantic mapping), it should surface the question to the user rather than hard-code.

---

## BUILD Stage Enforcement — the styling gate

The quality gate includes a styling check, implemented in `.claude/scripts/quality-gates.js` and run inline per story (the light gate, continue.md Step B4) and again in the epic-end full suite. The rule is:

- **Grep new files in `app-frontend/src/` for hex literals.** Any match outside `globals.css` fails the gate, with a remediation pointer to add a token instead.
- **Grep for inline colour functions** (`rgb(`, `rgba(`, `hsl(`, `oklch(`) outside `globals.css`. Same treatment.
- **Grep for Tailwind palette utilities** (`bg-[a-z]+-\d{3}`, `text-[a-z]+-\d{3}`, etc.) flagged as warnings (not failures) — these are tolerated in transient code but discouraged.

These checks are advisory until `design-style-agent` has produced a token override; once the override exists, they become hard gates.

---

## Forward Compatibility: `/style-update`

A future `/style-update` slash command will let users edit tokens after the project is built. Because every colour, font, radius, and shadow lives in `globals.css`, that command can:

1. Re-run `design-style-agent` against the user's new brand input
2. Diff the new token values against the existing ones
3. Write the new override into `globals.css`
4. **No component edits required** — Tailwind's JIT and Shadcn's token-based components pick up the new values automatically

If components had hard-coded values, the command would have to refactor 50+ files. With centralisation, it's one CSS file.

A future `/roles-update` command would have the same shape — change permissions in one place, propagate to route guards, UI visibility, and API authorization checks. Both would depend on this policy being followed.

---

## Rationale

Without centralisation, "sensible defaults until the user specifies" scatters across whatever component happened to be implemented first. By the time the user revisits styling — usually after seeing the running app — the brand-colour change becomes a multi-file refactor, often missing instances, often introducing visual regressions because nobody saw which component used which value.

Tokens are cheap to enforce up-front and dramatically reduce the surface area of future styling work. This is a one-time policy load that pays back every time the user wants to adjust the look.
