/**
 * doc-conventions.js
 *
 * Owns `.claude/shared/generated-doc-conventions.json` — where it lives, how to load it,
 * how to compile it, and how to classify a filename against it. Both consumers of the
 * schema are thin wrappers over this module and differ only in how they REACT:
 *   - .claude/hooks/enforce-generated-doc-names.js   (PreToolUse write-time enforcement)
 *   - .claude/scripts/validate-generated-doc-names.js (repo-wide audit)
 *
 * WHY THIS IS A SHARED MODULE: the two consumers each carried their own byte-identical
 * copy of `dirGlobToRegex`, and both copies shipped the same defect — the converter
 * translated `*` but not the `<slug>` placeholder, so a glob like
 * `generated-docs/epics/<slug>/` compiled to a regex matching the LITERAL text
 * `<slug>`. It never matched a real epic directory, so all four epic-scoped
 * conventions (brief.md, state.json, journal.md, story files) were dead branches:
 * wrongly-named files were written and audited with no check at all, failing open.
 * Only the two flat globs (`generated-docs/`, `app-frontend/e2e/`) enforced anything, which is
 * why it stayed hidden. Present since v0.4.0, when the epic-branch workflow introduced
 * the placeholder. Both consumers duplicated the classification loop around it too, so
 * the whole path lives here now — one definition, one place to fix.
 *
 * Usage:
 *   const dc = require('./lib/doc-conventions');       // from .claude/scripts/
 *   const dc = require('../scripts/lib/doc-conventions'); // from .claude/hooks/

/**
 * Compile a convention's `dirGlob` into a regex to test against a file's parent

 *
 * Supported syntax:
 *   `*`       — zero or more characters within ONE path segment.
 *   `<name>`  — a required single path segment (e.g. `<slug>` = an epic slug).
 *
 * Both compile to a character class that cannot cross `/`, which is what keeps the
 * conventions correctly scoped: `generated-docs/epics/<slug>/` matches
 * `generated-docs/epics/task-browsing/` but NOT `.../task-browsing/stories/`, so an
 * epic brief can never be confused with a story file. A `.*` would span `/` and break
 * that separation.
 *
 * `<name>` uses `[^/]+`, not `[^/]*`: a named placeholder stands for a segment that
 * must be present, so the empty match is wrong — with `*`, the glob above would also
 * match the bare `generated-docs/epics/` directory and treat it as an epic.
 *
 * THROWS on unsupported syntax (see dirGlobError) rather than returning a regex that
 * matches nothing: failing loudly is the only way an unsupported glob can't fail open.
