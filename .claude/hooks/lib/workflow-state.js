/**
 * workflow-state.js
 *
 * Shared helpers for workflow-guard.js, inject-phase-context.js, and
 * inject-agent-context.js under the epic-branch workflow.
 *
 * Port of the former lib/workflow-state.ps1. PowerShell (`powershell.exe`, plus
 * `-ExecutionPolicy Bypass`) exists only on Windows, which made the three hooks
 * that depended on it — including the workflow guard itself — silently no-op on
 * macOS and Linux. Node is already the runtime for the other two hooks and for
 * every .claude/scripts/* CLI, so it needs no new dependency.
 *
 * State path resolution comes from .claude/scripts/resolve-state-path.js, which
 * is required as a MODULE here rather than spawned as a subprocess (the .ps1
 * version shelled out to `node resolve-state-path.js` and parsed its stdout).
 * That removes a Node cold-start from every hook invocation — the latency the
 * old hooks needed a generous 10s timeout to absorb.
 *
 * Every helper is fail-safe: it returns null / an empty result rather than
 * throwing, mirroring the `$ErrorActionPreference = 'SilentlyContinue'` contract
 * of the PowerShell original. Hooks must never crash the harness.
