/**
 * workflow-guard.js
 *
 * UserPromptSubmit hook: injects workflow state context on every user prompt so
 * Claude can redirect users who attempt development work outside the /start and
 * /continue flow.
 *
 * Resolves state via .claude/scripts/resolve-state-path.js (required as a
 * module) — works on any branch, including main, where there's no active epic.
 * That resolve is LAZY (see buildGuardMessage): it runs on every user prompt, so
 * the branches that don't need it must not pay for the git lookup it does.
 *
 * Output: JSON with hookSpecificOutput.additionalContext
 * Fail-safe: exits 0 with no output on unexpected errors.
 *
 * Port of workflow-guard.ps1 — see lib/workflow-state.js for why. Note the
 * latency footnote the .ps1 version carried no longer applies: resolving state
 * used to spawn `node resolve-state-path.js` (which spawns git), so the hook
 * needed timeout headroom to avoid a mid-run kill that would fail open and let
 * out-of-workflow work proceed unguarded. This runs in-process; only the git
 * lookup remains, and only on the branches that need it.
